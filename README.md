# Kmisc

An actual README to come sometime in the future. For now, see the .Rmd file in
/Kmisc/inst/doc, knitting it and learning some of the things offered in Kmisc.

Install me in R with `devtools` with the following call:

    install_github("cdrv", "Kmisc", subdir="Kmisc")
    
(the `subdir` argument is necessary as I include source tarballs in the base directory, and the actual source itself in this sub-directory)
