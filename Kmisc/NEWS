Version 0.3.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Fixed compatibility issues with old versions of R (no calls to paste0()).
  * Added str_rev2(), for reversing of UTF-8 strings (str_rev() remains for
    speed reasons when using ASCII characters). Similarily with str_slice()
    and str_slice2().
  * Added str_sort(), a function for sorting a (possibly UTF-8 encoded) 
    string lexically.
  * Reintroduced Rcpp dependency and will keep it from here on out.
  * Updated documentation on extract() / without().
  * Improved error checking in extract() / without() - now ensures that the
    symbols passed to ... are atomic

Version 0.2.0
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * Added some useful string operations: str_rev() and str_slice(). These
    functions are written in C for fast execution.
  * Added in.interval(), a function for checking whether each element of
    a vector x lies within an interval [lo, hi).
  * Added extract.re(), without.re() for extracting named objects; objects with
    names matching / not-matching the RE supplied are returned
  * Fixed bug with HTML tag functions handling of functions as arguments
  * Functions no longer depend on Rcpp - may be reintroduced in future
  * Minor changes to code for R <2.15.0 compatibility
  * Updated documentation + DESCRIPTION for clarity
  * Package now byte compiles by default
  * Introduced attachHTML(), detachHTML() functions for attaching commonly
    used HTML functions (ie, they do not mask any base package functions)
  * Exported makeHTMLTag() function, added documentation + examples
  * Fixed bug in read.cb() for Mac systems
  * Added scan.cb(), for getting non-tabular data from clipboard
